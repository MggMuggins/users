# redox_users

Redox OS APIs for accessing users and groups information.

High level APIs for:

- Getting the current process effective user ID.
- Getting the current process user ID.
- Getting the current process effective group ID.
- Getting the current process group ID.
- Manipulating User and Group information (including adding, removing, and modifying groups and users, in addition to other functionality, see docs)

We recommend to use these APIs instead of directly manipulating the
`/etc/group` and `/etc/passwd` as this is an implementation detail and
might change in the future.

## Using redox_users

Make sure you have Rust nightly.

Add `redox_users` to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.redox_users]
git = "https://github.com/redox-os/users.git"
```

then import it in your main file:

```rust
extern crate redox_users;
```

And `redox_users` is now ready to roll!

## Hashing
redox_users uses the Argon2 hashing algorithm. The default hashing parameters are as follows:
```Rust
Argon2::new(10, 1, 4096, Variant::Argon2i)
```
